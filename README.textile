h1. This is the data for my blog

It is automatically transformed by "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

I forked this blog from "Tom-Preston-Werner's":http://tom.preston-werner.com/  because I am not overly concerned with the look of the thing for now and just want something I can add posts to. Maybe I will pretty it up later.
