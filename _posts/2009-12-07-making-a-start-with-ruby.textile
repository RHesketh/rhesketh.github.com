I am an absolute newcomer to the world of Ruby, being more typically found working with "C#":http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/default.aspx in "Visual Studio":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio on Windows. Having heard nice things from others, however, and lacking anything better to do with my time, I have decided to give it a try.

Being a Windows user primarily, an interest in Ruby has introduced me to other technologies which I am currently just as inexperienced with. These include the Linux operating system, git, GitHub, Pivotal Tracker, Textile and a number of other wonderful things. I hope to improve my familiarity with all of these as I work on personal pet projects to gain experience, and will be writing about the results on this blog as well as uploading various bits of code to my GitHub repositories.

To start with I'll be working on little tasks set by my friend "Elliot":http://github.com/elliotcm as well as reading the "Programming Ruby":http://pragprog.com/titles/ruby/programming-ruby book which he has recommended to me. That should be enough to occupy whatever free time I have over the next few months.
